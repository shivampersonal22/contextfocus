# contextfocus
ContextFocus is a smart focus blocker that activates automatically — no timers, no manual buttons, no setup required.

The moment you open a work tab (Notion, GitHub, Google Docs, Figma, Linear, Jira, VS Code, Slack, and 25+ others), ContextFocus instantly blocks distracting websites like YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, TikTok, Netflix, and more.

HOW IT WORKS:
Open a work tab → Focus mode activates automatically → Distractions are blocked until you're done

FEATURES:
- Auto-detects 30+ work tools including Notion, GitHub, Figma, Google Workspace, Linear, Jira, Trello, Asana, Miro, Zoom, Slack, and more
- Blocks 15 distraction sites by default — fully customizable
- Live focus timer shows how long you've been in the zone
- 3 modes: Auto (recommended), Manual, or Off
- 10-second override delay so you can still access a site if truly needed
- Sweeps already-open distraction tabs when focus activates
- Add custom work domains for your company's internal tools
- Tracks daily and total focus time
- Zero signup, zero account, zero data collected

PERFECT FOR:
Developers, designers, writers, students, and remote workers who struggle with distraction while working.

ContextFocus is free and open source. Install it and just open Notion or GitHub — it handles the rest.

2. Open any of these URLs in a new tab:
   - https://notion.so (or any Google Docs / GitHub page)
3. The extension popup badge will show "ON" and turn green automatically
4. Now try to open https://www.youtube.com in any tab
5. You will be redirected to the built-in blocked page (blocked.html)

7. Clicking "I really need this site" starts a 10-second countdown before allowing access

HOW TO TEST MANUAL MODE:
